# swift-playgrounds

This repo contains a set of Playgrounds that each focus on exploring a certain aspect of Swift 3:

* [literal-convertibility.playground](https://github.com/littlefacto/swift-playgrounds/tree/master/literal-convertibility.playground) explains what is the concept of literal convertibility, and provide concrete examples of how to implement it.

* [not-so-good-structs-inheritance.playground](https://github.com/littlefacto/swift-playgrounds/tree/master/not-so-good-structs-inheritance.playground) proposes an attractive, but in the end not very usable solution to bring inheritance to struct types.

* [better-structs-inheritance.playground](https://github.com/littlefacto/swift-playgrounds/tree/master/better-structs-inheritance.playground) offers a much more reliable way to factor-out common business logic when dealing with struct types.

* [simulate-inheritance-with-structs.playground](https://github.com/littlefacto/swift-playgrounds/tree/master/simulate-inheritance-with-structs.playground) offers a different approach that relies on enumerations.
